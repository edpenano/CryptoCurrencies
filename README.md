# CryptoCurrencies

Using SwiftUI to create an encyclopedia of cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies follow the MVC design pattern (organized into related folders for easy reading).
OnboardingView, ContentView, and DetailView are included and implemented into the MainAppView.

Static Data Model uses NavigationLink to send data and display data to DetailView.

Modifiers were coded for custom UI design.

Assets: cryptocurrency symbols, logo, and gradientColors.
