    cryptoCurrency(title: "Bitcoin", headline: "The original digital currency", image: "bitcoin", gradientColors: [Color("ColorGrapefruitLight"), Color("ColorGrapefruitDark")], description: "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: transaction management and money issuance are carried out collectively by the network. The original Bitcoin software by Satoshi Nakamoto was released under the MIT license. Most client software, derived or from scratch, also use open source licensing. Bitcoin is the first successful implementation of a distributed crypto-currency, described in part in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central authorities. Bitcoins have all the desirable properties of a money-like good. They are portable, durable, divisible, recognizable, fungible, scarce and difficult to counterfeit.", currentPrice: ["$23,000", "No. 1"]),
    cryptoCurrency(title: "XRP", headline: "XRP is a digital asset built for payments and settles transactions in 3-5 seconds.", image: "xrp", gradientColors: [Color("ColorBlueberryLight"), Color("ColorBlueberryDark")], description: "XRP is a digital asset that’s native to the XRP Ledger, an open-source, permissionless and decentralized blockchain technology. Created in 2012 specifically for payments, XRP can settle transactions on the ledger in 3-5 seconds. It was built to be a better Bitcoin—faster, cheaper and greener than any other digital asset. XRP can be sent directly without needing a central intermediary, making it a convenient instrument in bridging two different currencies quickly and efficiently. It is freely exchanged on the open market and used in the real world for enabling cross-border payments and microtransactions. Unlike Bitcoin, there is a finite amount of XRP. All XRP is already in existence today—100 billion in total. The XRP Ledger is open-source technology on which anyone can build. The XRP Ledger is maintained by a global “XRP Community”—a diverse set of participants composed of software engineers, server operators and validators. The XRP Ledger uses a consensus protocol, in which validators come to an agreement on the order of XRP transactions every 3-5 seconds. This agreement serves as the final and irreversible settlement. Transactions are executed in a deterministic order to prevent double spending and malicious activity. Unlike other blockchains, transaction fees are destroyed as part of transaction execution. The XRP Ledger adjusts fees in near real time to respond to network conditions, with the twin goals of maximizing transaction throughput while keeping transaction fees as low as possible. All servers in the network process each transaction according to the same rules, and any transaction that follows the protocol is confirmed as soon as validators reach a quorum.", currentPrice: ["$0.50", "No. 3"]),
    cryptoCurrency(title: "Ethereum", headline: "Gas lights the system", image: "ethereum", gradientColors: [Color("ColorPomegranateLight"), Color("ColorPomegranateDark")], description: "Ethereum is a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee. It also powers applications that everyone can use and no one can take down. It's the world's programmable blockchain. Ethereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets – even Bitcoin! This also means Ethereum is for more than payments. It's a marketplace of financial services, games and apps that can't steal your data or censor you.", currentPrice: ["$600", "No. 2"])
